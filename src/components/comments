Populate all componnets by typing rfce
Import the Todo wrapper in App.js
Copy CSS 
Work on Todo Form
Import the Todo Form in the Todo wrapper
Think logically what the next step should be => todo form is used to add todos.
At this step, The Todo wrapper will give you a subset component of the Todo form, which will have, a placeholder and a submit btn.
"useState" -- this is to keep track of what user is typing
"onChange" -- this is to get the value of the user input, what the user types in the placeholder
"setValue" -- this is used to save it to the state
"handleSubmit" -- this is a function that captures the value of the state when we submit the form, this function is created outside the return stmt
"preventDefault"-- this is to prevent the auto reload of the page whenever submit is triggered
The value entered is getting consoled at this point, now we need to send it to the main wrapper component and print it out
So, make use of useState and props to send from Form to Wrapper
Make use of a function addTodo 
Add value in the Form, so that todo gets printed out
Display the todos now - go to Todo.js now
Use map to display all todos
Mark complete when todo is done
Use maps and logic to do this
Set up the Delete Function
Use filter and logic to do this
